# Airdrop Analysis
Analysis and datasets for 6MV's airdrop analysis piece

# Adding Token Metadata
`metadata.py` holds a list of token metada objects. Add to this list as a first step in adding new tokens for analysis. 

# Getting Price Data
Price data can be queried using the relevant functions in `api.py`. 

# Getting Wallet Data
This repository does not include functions for querying wallet data, as that process is far more complicated and variable. We recommend using Flipside Crypto and Dune Analytics as starting points.
